Pros vs Cons of Agile Development

Pros
No periods where the project is Stagnant / the consumers are recieving no updates.
Smaller team sizes that can cross collabrate when needed.

Cons
Developers need to spend more of their time on DevOps / administrative things.
Requires more upfront work (planning, setting up the workflows) than compared to the waterfall mentality.
