Pros vs Cons of Agile Development

Pros
No periods where the project is Stagnant / the consumers are recieving no updates.
Smaller team sizes that can cross collabrate when needed.

Cons
Developers need to spend more of their time on DevOps / administrative things.
Requires more upfront work (planning, setting up the workflows) than compared to the waterfall mentality.




Scrum Master vs Product Owner

The project owner is the one who sets the direction of the project / team, is responsible for facilating releases, and managing stakeholders (making sure upper management is happy, the consumers like the product, etc).

The scrum master is responsible for implementing the Scrum workflow. They are responsible for the JIRA tooling, setting up sprints and meetings, and holding team members accountable for their stories/issues.



Three types of Meetings

Sprint Planning:
- Figure out what needs to be completed in the next sprint
- Determine the story points of all tasks and assign them

Daily Scrum / Standup
- Discuss work completed yesterday
- Discuss daily plan and blocking issues

Sprint Retrospective Meeting
- Discuss what was completed during the sprint
- Move any incomplete work to the backlog



Types of Issues

Epic - a large amount of work that can be broken into several sub-sections (stories)

Story - a unit of work typically reserved for software development

Bug - Something that is causing the product to not work as expected

Task - a unit of work typically reserved for non-software development work ie documentation or preparing for meetings.
